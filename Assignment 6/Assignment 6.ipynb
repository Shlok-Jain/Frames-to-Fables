        "You may try variety of models including those based on CLIP, BLIP, Vision-Language Models, Visual Transfrmers, etc. (These are variuos multimodal architectures, you read more about their architectures, uses, etc. online). You can simply google \"image captioning models HuggingFace\" based on any architecture (CLIP, BLIP, VLM, etc.) and you will find many models that you can try.\n",
        "You may also look into their benchmark results to choose most suitable even before trying them out.\n",

        "\n",

This reduces the memory footprint of the model and makes it easier to run on limited resources. However this may also reduce the performance of the model, so you should try to find a balance between the size and performance of the model.\n",
